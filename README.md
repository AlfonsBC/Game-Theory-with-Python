In this repository you will see important and insightful notebooks to introduce you to Game Theory with Python.
This course is taken by COURSERA
''Welcome to Game Theory with Python. By the end of this project, you will be fluent with the following game theoretic concepts: Two player Static and Dynamic Games, Pure and Mixed strategy Nash Equilibria for static games (illustrations with unique and multiple solutions), Example of Axelrod tournament. You will be building two player Nash games and analyze them using Python packages Nashpy and Axelrod, especially built for game theoretic analyses. You will gain the understanding of computational mechanisms related to the aforementioned concepts.''
## Objectives
- Learn to implement Nash Games using Python packages Nashpy and Axelrod
- Understand Pure and Mixed strategies of a game and learn to interpret the results
- Gain conceptual understanding of Static and Dynamic Games
